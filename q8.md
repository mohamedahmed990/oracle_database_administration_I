### **Question Analysis**
You need to write a SQL query that:
1. **Selects `cust_first_name` and the due amount**, which is **5% (`0.05`) of `cust_credit_limit`**.
2. **Filters customers based on `cust_income_level`** (should not be `NULL`).
3. **Excludes rows where the calculated due amount is NULL**.

---

### **Correct Answer:**  
‚úÖ **E.**
```sql
SELECT cust_first_name, cust_credit_limit * .05 AS DUE_AMOUNT
FROM customers
WHERE cust_income_level IS NOT NULL 
AND cust_credit_limit IS NOT NULL;
```

---

### **Explanation:**
1. **Why `cust_income_level IS NOT NULL`?**  
   - The question specifies **only customers whose income level has a value** (i.e., it should not be NULL).  
   - The `IS NOT NULL` condition is the correct way to filter out NULL values.

2. **Why `cust_credit_limit IS NOT NULL`?**  
   - The **due amount is calculated** as `cust_credit_limit * 0.05`.  
   - If `cust_credit_limit` is `NULL`, the **result of the multiplication would also be NULL** (because any arithmetic operation with `NULL` results in `NULL` in SQL).  
   - So, we need to ensure `cust_credit_limit` is **not NULL** to avoid NULL results.

### **Why Other Answers Are Incorrect?**
| Option | Why It's Incorrect? |
|--------|----------------------|
| **A** | ‚ùå Uses `due_amount IS NOT NULL`, but `due_amount` is **not an actual column** in the table. It's just an alias in the SELECT statement. |
| **B** | ‚ùå Uses `!= NULL` instead of `IS NOT NULL`. In SQL, `!= NULL` is **incorrect**. Use `IS NOT NULL`. |
| **C** | ‚ùå Uses `<> NULL`, which is also incorrect. `NULL` comparisons require `IS NOT NULL`. |
| **D** | ‚ùå Similar to option A, it checks `due_amount IS NOT NULL`, but `due_amount` **does not exist as a column**. |

---

### **Final Answer:**  
‚úÖ **E.**  
```sql
SELECT cust_first_name, cust_credit_limit * .05 AS DUE_AMOUNT
FROM customers
WHERE cust_income_level IS NOT NULL 
AND cust_credit_limit IS NOT NULL;
```

üîπ **Key SQL Concepts Used:**  
- **Filtering NULL values** with `IS NOT NULL` (‚úÖ Correct).  
- **Avoiding incorrect comparisons** like `!= NULL` or `<> NULL` (‚ùå Incorrect).  
- **Using arithmetic operations safely** by ensuring values are not NULL before performing calculations.
