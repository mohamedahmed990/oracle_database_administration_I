Sure! Here is a more detailed explanation for each option in the question regarding the **INTERSECT** operator:

### **Question:**  
Which statement is true about the **INTERSECT** operator used in compound queries?  

#### **Options:**  
**A)** Multiple INTERSECT operators are not possible in the same SQL statement  
**B)** It processes NULLs in the selected columns  
**C)** INTERSECT is of lower precedence than UNION or UNION ALL  
**D)** It ignores NULLs  

---

### **Correct Answer:**  
‚úÖ **B) It processes NULLs in the selected columns**  

---

### **Explanation of Each Option:**  

#### **Option A: Multiple INTERSECT operators are not possible in the same SQL statement ‚Üí ‚ùå Incorrect**  
- **INTERSECT can be used multiple times** in the same SQL query.  
- You can chain multiple **INTERSECT** operations together, just like **UNION** or **UNION ALL**.  
- Example:  
  ```sql
  SELECT emp_id FROM employees  
  INTERSECT  
  SELECT emp_id FROM managers  
  INTERSECT  
  SELECT emp_id FROM hr_staff;
  ```
  This query finds employee IDs that exist in **all three tables**.  

#### **Option B: It processes NULLs in the selected columns ‚Üí ‚úÖ Correct**  
- **INTERSECT includes NULL values** when checking for common rows.  
- Example:  
  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM table1  
  INTERSECT  
  SELECT name FROM table2;
  ```
  If `table1` and `table2` both contain a row with `NULL`, that row will be included in the result set.  
- This is different from **JOINs**, where `NULL = NULL` evaluates to **FALSE** unless `IS NULL` is explicitly used.  

#### **Option C: INTERSECT is of lower precedence than UNION or UNION ALL ‚Üí ‚ùå Incorrect**  
- The **INTERSECT** operator has **higher precedence** than **UNION** and **UNION ALL**.  
- This means that if you mix **INTERSECT** with **UNION**, Oracle processes **INTERSECT first**, unless you use parentheses.  
- Example:  
  ```sql
  SELECT emp_id FROM employees  
  INTERSECT  
  SELECT emp_id FROM managers  
  UNION  
  SELECT emp_id FROM hr_staff;
  ```
  - Here, **INTERSECT executes first**, and then the **UNION** is applied to the results.  
  - To change the order, you would use parentheses:  
    ```sql
    (SELECT emp_id FROM employees  
    INTERSECT  
    SELECT emp_id FROM managers)  
    UNION  
    SELECT emp_id FROM hr_staff;
    ```  

#### **Option D: It ignores NULLs ‚Üí ‚ùå Incorrect**  
- **INTERSECT does NOT ignore NULLs.**  
- If a `NULL` value exists in both result sets, it **will be included** in the final output.  
- This is because INTERSECT **compares entire rows, including NULL values**.  

---

### **Summary:**  
- **INTERSECT returns only common rows** between two queries.  
- It **processes NULLs**, so **option B is correct**.  
- **INTERSECT has a higher precedence** than **UNION/UNION ALL**.  
- **Multiple INTERSECT operators can be used in a single SQL query**.  
- **NULL values are not ignored** but are considered when matching rows.  

Thus, the correct answer is:  
‚úÖ **B) It processes NULLs in the selected columns** üöÄ
