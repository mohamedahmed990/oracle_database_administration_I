### **Question:**  
Which three statements are **true** concerning **logical and physical database structures**? **(Choose three.)**  

**A.** All tablespaces may have one or more data files  
**B.** The extents of a segment must always reside in the same datafile  
**C.** A smallfile tablespace might be bigger than a bigfile tablespace  
**D.** A segment can span multiple data files in some tablespaces  
**E.** A segment's blocks can be of different sizes  
**F.** A segment might have only one extent  
**G.** Segments can span multiple tablespaces  

---

### **Answer:**  
✅ **C. A smallfile tablespace might be bigger than a bigfile tablespace**  
✅ **D. A segment can span multiple data files in some tablespaces**  
✅ **F. A segment might have only one extent**  

---

### **Explanation:**  

#### **Oracle Database Logical and Physical Storage Structure**
- **Tablespaces** contain **segments** (such as tables and indexes).  
- **Segments** consist of **extents**, which are groups of contiguous **blocks**.  
- **Extents** are stored in **data files**.

### **Why Are C, D, and F Correct?**  

✅ **C. A smallfile tablespace might be bigger than a bigfile tablespace**  
- A **bigfile tablespace** contains **only one large data file**.  
- A **smallfile tablespace** can have **multiple smaller data files**.  
- If a **smallfile tablespace** contains **many** data files, it **can be larger** than a single bigfile tablespace.  

✅ **D. A segment can span multiple data files in some tablespaces**  
- In **smallfile tablespaces**, a segment **can span multiple data files**.  
- **Bigfile tablespaces** contain only **one data file**, so segments **cannot** span multiple files there.  

✅ **F. A segment might have only one extent**  
- A **segment** consists of **at least one extent**.  
- When a segment is **initially created**, it starts with **one extent** and can grow as needed.

### **Why Are the Other Options Incorrect?**  

| Option | Explanation |
|--------|------------|
| **A. All tablespaces may have one or more data files** | ❌ **Wrong** → **Bigfile tablespaces** have only **one data file**. **Smallfile tablespaces** can have multiple data files. |
| **B. The extents of a segment must always reside in the same data file** | ❌ **Wrong** → A **segment’s extents** can be **distributed across multiple data files** in a smallfile tablespace. |
| **E. A segment's blocks can be of different sizes** | ❌ **Wrong** → All blocks in a segment **must have the same size**, as defined by the **tablespace block size**. |
| **G. Segments can span multiple tablespaces** | ❌ **Wrong** → A **segment belongs to only one tablespace**. However, **partitioned tables** can have **partitions in different tablespaces**, but each partition is its own segment. |

---

### **Final Answer:**  
✅ **C. A smallfile tablespace might be bigger than a bigfile tablespace**  
✅ **D. A segment can span multiple data files in some tablespaces**  
✅ **F. A segment might have only one extent**
