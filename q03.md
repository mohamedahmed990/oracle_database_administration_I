### **Question:**  
The `ORCL` database has the following settings:  
- **`RESUMABLE_TIMEOUT = 7200`**  
- **`DEFERRED_SEGMENT_CREATION = FALSE`**  

User **U1** has a **1 MB quota** in the `DATA` tablespace.  

U1 executes the following command:  

```sql
SQL> CREATE TABLE t1 AS  
(SELECT object_name, sharing, created  
FROM dba_objects);
```

U1 complains that the command is **taking too long** to execute.  

The **alert log** shows:  

```
2017-03-06T12:15:17.183438+05:30
statement in resumable session 'User U1(136), Session 1, Instance 1' was suspended due to ORA-01536: space quota exceeded for tablespace 'DATA'
```

### **Which are three actions, any one of which, the DBA could take to resume the session?**  
(Choose **three**)

**A.** Add a data file to `DATA`  
**B.** Drop other U1 objects in `DATA`  
**C.** Increase U1's quota sufficiently in `DATA`  
**D.** Set `DEFERRED_SEGMENT_CREATION` to `TRUE`  
**E.** Grant `UNLIMITED TABLESPACE` to U1  
**F.** Set `AUTOEXTEND ON` for data files in `DATA`  

---

### **Correct Answers:**  
✅ **B. Drop other U1 objects in DATA**  
✅ **C. Increase U1's quota sufficiently in DATA**  
✅ **E. Grant UNLIMITED TABLESPACE to U1**  

---

### **Explanation:**  
The error **ORA-01536: space quota exceeded** means that **User U1** has exceeded their **1 MB quota** in the `DATA` tablespace. Since `RESUMABLE_TIMEOUT = 7200`, the session is **suspended** for 7200 seconds (2 hours), allowing the DBA to resolve the issue.  

Any of the following actions will allow the session to resume:  

1. **Drop Other U1 Objects in DATA (✅ Option B)**  
   - If **User U1** has existing objects in the `DATA` tablespace, dropping them **frees up quota**, allowing the session to continue.  
   - This is a **valid workaround** if increasing quota or granting unlimited tablespace is not an option.  

2. **Increase U1’s Quota Sufficiently in DATA (✅ Option C)**  
   - Since **U1 has a strict 1 MB quota**, increasing it will allow the table creation to complete.  
   - The DBA can increase the quota using:  
     ```sql
     ALTER USER U1 QUOTA 10M ON DATA;
     ```  
   - This is the **most direct solution**.  

3. **Grant UNLIMITED TABLESPACE to U1 (✅ Option E)**  
   - The `UNLIMITED TABLESPACE` privilege removes quota restrictions, allowing **U1** to use as much space as available in `DATA`.  
   - The DBA can do this using:  
     ```sql
     GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO U1;
     ```  
   - This **permanently removes quota issues** for U1, but might not be desirable if space needs to be controlled.

### **Why Other Options Are Incorrect?**  
| Option | Query | Why It’s Incorrect |
|--------|-------|--------------------|
| **A** | Add a data file to `DATA` | ❌ The issue is **not lack of tablespace space**, but **U1’s quota restriction**. Adding a data file increases total space but does **not** affect U1’s quota. |
| **D** | Set `DEFERRED_SEGMENT_CREATION = TRUE` | ❌ This setting controls **whether segment allocation is delayed** for tables, but it does **not** help in this case because U1 still has a strict quota limit. |
| **F** | Set `AUTOEXTEND ON` for data files in `DATA` | ❌ Autoextend allows the tablespace to grow, but **U1’s quota remains limited**. This won’t help unless U1’s quota is increased. |

### **Final Answer:**  
✅ **B. Drop other U1 objects in DATA**  
✅ **C. Increase U1's quota sufficiently in DATA**  
✅ **E. Grant UNLIMITED TABLESPACE to U1**
