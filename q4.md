### **Question:**  
In one of your databases, the user **HR** has the password **HRMGR**.  
You want to connect to a database instance whose **listener listens on port 1531** using the following statement:  

```sql
CONNECT HR/HRMGR@orcl
```
No name server is used.  

Which statement is **true** about **ORCL**?  

**A.** It must be the value of the `SERVICE_NAMES` parameter on the client side  
**B.** It must resolve to a valid **connect descriptor** in the server's `tnsnames.ora` file  
**C.** It must resolve to a valid **connect descriptor** in the client's `tnsnames.ora` file  
**D.** It must be the **name of the database** to whose instance HR wishes to connect  
**E.** It must be the **name of the server** running the database to whose instance HR wishes to connect

### **Correct Answer:**  
✅ **C. It must resolve to a valid connect descriptor in the client's `tnsnames.ora` file**

### **Explanation:**  

When connecting to an Oracle database using:  

```sql
CONNECT username/password@connect_identifier
```
- **`orcl`** is the **connect identifier**.  
- **No name server is used**, which means **TNS resolution** is required.  
- Oracle first checks the **client-side `tnsnames.ora` file** to resolve `orcl` into a **connect descriptor** that specifies the **host, port (1531), and service name**.  
- The **server-side `tnsnames.ora` is irrelevant** for client connections—it only matters when the database server itself initiates a connection to another database.  

#### **Example of a valid `tnsnames.ora` entry on the client:**
```ini
ORCL =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = myserver)(PORT = 1531))
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVICE_NAME = orcl)
    )
  )
```
- The client uses this entry to translate `orcl` into a proper database connection.

### **Why the Other Options Are Incorrect?**  

| Option | Why It’s Incorrect |
|--------|--------------------|
| **A. It must be the value of the `SERVICE_NAMES` parameter on the client side** | ❌ **Wrong** → `SERVICE_NAMES` is a **database initialization parameter** (set in `spfile` or `init.ora`). The client **does not** use this to connect. |
| **B. It must resolve to a valid connect descriptor in the server's `tnsnames.ora` file** | ❌ **Wrong** → The **server's `tnsnames.ora` is irrelevant** for a client-side connection. It is used when the database itself needs to connect to another database (e.g., DB Links). |
| **D. It must be the name of the database to whose instance HR wishes to connect** | ❌ **Wrong** → The **database name** is stored in `DB_NAME`, but connections typically use the **SERVICE_NAME** instead. A client connects using a **service name, not the DB_NAME**. |
| **E. It must be the name of the server running the database** | ❌ **Wrong** → The **server name (hostname) is different from the connect identifier**. A client connects using `orcl`, which maps to a **network service name**, not a server hostname. |
