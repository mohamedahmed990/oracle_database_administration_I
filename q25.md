### **Question:**  
Which data type should be used for a column in a banking application that:  
1. **Supports date arithmetic** without conversion functions  
2. **Stores a loan period of up to 10 years**  
3. **Is used for calculating interest based on the number of unpaid days**  

---

### **Analysis of Each Option:**

#### **A) `INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH` ‚Üí ‚ùå Incorrect**  
- **Stores a period of years and months** (e.g., `5-06` for 5 years 6 months).  
- **Does not support day-based calculations** effectively.  
- **Not suitable** for calculating interest **based on days**.  

---

#### **B) `INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND` ‚Üí ‚úÖ Correct**  
- **Stores a duration in days, hours, minutes, and seconds** (e.g., `365 12:00:00` for 365 days, 12 hours).  
- **Supports direct date arithmetic**:  
  ```sql
  SELECT loan_start_date + INTERVAL '365' DAY FROM loans;
  ```
- **Best choice for tracking unpaid loan days** for interest calculations.  

---

#### **C) `TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIMEZONE` ‚Üí ‚ùå Incorrect**  
- Stores absolute **timestamps** with session-dependent time zones.  
- **Does not represent a loan period** (e.g., ‚Äú10 years‚Äù is not a fixed timestamp).  
- **Not useful for interest calculations** based on elapsed days.  

---

#### **D) `TIMESTAMP` ‚Üí ‚ùå Incorrect**  
- Stores an **exact point in time** rather than a **duration**.  
- Cannot **directly represent a loan period** of "10 years".  
- **Needs conversion functions** for date arithmetic.  

---

#### **E) `TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE` ‚Üí ‚ùå Incorrect**  
- Similar to `TIMESTAMP`, but with an **explicit time zone**.  
- **Not suitable** for storing loan durations.  
- Does **not simplify date arithmetic** for unpaid loan periods.  

---

### **Final Answer:**  
‚úÖ **B) `INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND`**  
üöÄ **Best choice for handling date arithmetic and calculating interest based on unpaid days!**
