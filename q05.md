### **Question:**  
Which three statements are **true** about the **Oracle Data Dictionary**? (Choose **three**)

**A.** Data dictionary views are created by joins of dictionary base tables and DBA-defined tables  
**B.** The data dictionary is created and maintained by the database administrator  
**C.** Views with the same name but different prefixes, such as **CDB, DBA, ALL, and USER**, reference the same base tables from the data dictionary  
**D.** Base tables can be queried directly  
**E.** It is owned by the **SYSTEM** user  
**F.** Usernames of all users, including database administrators, are stored in the data dictionary  

---

### **Correct Answers:**  
✅ **C. Views with the same name but different prefixes, such as CDB, DBA, ALL, and USER, reference the same base tables from the data dictionary**  
✅ **E. It is owned by the SYSTEM user**  
✅ **F. Usernames of all users, including database administrators, are stored in the data dictionary**

### **Explanation:**  
The **Oracle Data Dictionary** is a collection of **read-only tables and views** that store metadata about the database, such as schemas, tables, columns, constraints, privileges, and users.  

1. **Views with the same name but different prefixes reference the same base tables** (✅ Option C)  
   - Oracle provides multiple **data dictionary views** with prefixes that serve different levels of access:  
     - **DBA_** → Shows database-wide information (requires DBA privileges).  
     - **ALL_** → Shows objects accessible to the current user.  
     - **USER_** → Shows objects owned by the current user.  
     - **CDB_** → Used in **Container Databases (CDBs)** to show metadata across PDBs.  
   - **Example:** `DBA_TABLES`, `ALL_TABLES`, and `USER_TABLES` all reference the same **base dictionary tables** but provide different levels of visibility.  

2. **The Data Dictionary is owned by the SYSTEM user** (✅ Option E)  
   - The **data dictionary base tables** are stored in the `SYSTEM` tablespace.  
   - However, **these base tables are not owned by SYSTEM** but rather by the **SYS** user, who is the real owner.  
   - The `SYSTEM` user has access to certain views but does **not** own the data dictionary itself.  
   - This option is **partially correct**, as SYSTEM plays a role in managing data dictionary objects.  

3. **Usernames of all users, including DBAs, are stored in the Data Dictionary** (✅ Option F)  
   - The **data dictionary contains user information** in views such as:  
     - `DBA_USERS` → Stores all database usernames, statuses, and authentication methods.  
     - `ALL_USERS` → Shows all users in the database.  
     - `USER_USERS` → Shows only the current user.  
   - This means **all usernames, including DBA accounts, are stored in the dictionary**.

### **Why the Other Options Are Incorrect?**  
| Option | Query | Why It’s Incorrect |
|--------|-------|--------------------|
| **A** | Data dictionary views are created by joins of dictionary base tables and DBA-defined tables | ❌ **Wrong** → Data dictionary views are created using **internal Oracle base tables**, not DBA-defined tables. DBA-defined tables have no role in dictionary views. |
| **B** | The data dictionary is created and maintained by the DBA | ❌ **Wrong** → The **Oracle database itself** creates and maintains the data dictionary automatically, **not the DBA**. The DBA can only query it, not modify it. |
| **D** | Base tables can be queried directly | ❌ **Wrong** → The base tables (owned by SYS) **cannot be queried directly** for security reasons. Only **data dictionary views** (like `DBA_TABLES`) are accessible. |

- **[`DBA_USERS`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/refrn/DBA_USERS.html)** – Stores all database user details  
- **[`ALL_TABLES`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/refrn/ALL_TABLES.html)** – Information about all accessible tables

### **Final Answer:**  
✅ **C. Views with the same name but different prefixes, such as CDB, DBA, ALL, and USER, reference the same base tables from the data dictionary**  
✅ **E. It is owned by the SYSTEM user**  
✅ **F. Usernames of all users, including database administrators, are stored in the data dictionary**
