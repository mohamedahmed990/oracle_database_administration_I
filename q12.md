### **Question:**  
Which two statements are true about the **WHERE** and **HAVING** clauses in a `SELECT` statement? **(Choose two.)**  

**A.** Aggregating functions and columns used in **HAVING** clauses must be specified in the `SELECT` list of a query  
**B.** **WHERE** and **HAVING** clauses can be used in the same statement only if applied to different table columns  
**C.** The **HAVING** clause can be used with aggregating functions in subqueries  
**D.** The **WHERE** clause can be used to exclude rows **before** dividing them into groups  
**E.** The **WHERE** clause can be used to exclude rows **after** dividing them into groups  

---

### **Answer:**  
✅ **C. The HAVING clause can be used with aggregating functions in subqueries**  
✅ **D. The WHERE clause can be used to exclude rows before dividing them into groups**

### **Explanation:**  

1. **Why is C correct?**  
   - The **HAVING** clause can be used in **subqueries** with **aggregate functions**.  
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) 
     FROM employees 
     GROUP BY department_id 
     HAVING AVG(salary) > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
     ```
   - This query selects departments where the **average salary** is **greater than the overall average salary**.

2. **Why is D correct?**  
   - The **WHERE** clause filters **rows before** they are grouped.  
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT department_id, AVG(salary)
     FROM employees
     WHERE job_id = 'IT_PROG' -- Filters data before grouping
     GROUP BY department_id;
     ```
   - Here, only employees with `job_id = 'IT_PROG'` are included before applying `GROUP BY`.

### **Why are the other options incorrect?**  

❌ **A. Aggregating functions and columns used in HAVING clauses must be specified in the SELECT list of a query**  
   - **Incorrect**, because **HAVING** can reference aggregate functions even if they are not in the `SELECT` list.  
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT department_id
     FROM employees
     GROUP BY department_id
     HAVING AVG(salary) > 5000;
     ```
   - The `AVG(salary)` function is **not in the SELECT list**, but the query is **valid**.

❌ **B. WHERE and HAVING clauses can be used in the same statement only if applied to different table columns**  
   - **Incorrect**, because `WHERE` and `HAVING` can **both apply to the same column**, just at different stages.  
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT department_id, SUM(salary)
     FROM employees
     WHERE salary > 5000 -- Filters individual rows
     GROUP BY department_id
     HAVING SUM(salary) > 20000; -- Filters grouped data
     ```
   - Both `WHERE` and `HAVING` work on the **salary** column.

❌ **E. The WHERE clause can be used to exclude rows after dividing them into groups**  
   - **Incorrect**, because `WHERE` applies **before grouping**, and `HAVING` applies **after** grouping.  
   - To filter groups, you **must use HAVING**, not `WHERE`.

### **Final Answer:**  
✅ **C. The HAVING clause can be used with aggregating functions in subqueries**  
✅ **D. The WHERE clause can be used to exclude rows before dividing them into groups**
