### **Question:**  
A database is configured to use **automatic undo management** with **temporary undo enabled**.  

An **UPDATE** is executed on a **temporary table**.  

**Where is the UNDO stored?**  

**A.** in the undo tablespace  
**B.** in the SYSAUX tablespace  
**C.** in the SGA  
**D.** in the PGA  
**E.** in the temporary tablespace

### **Answer:**  
‚úÖ **E. in the temporary tablespace**  

---

### **Explanation:**  

1. **What is Temporary Undo?**  
   - Normally, undo data is stored in the **UNDO tablespace**.  
   - However, when **temporary tables** are modified, Oracle **stores the undo in the temporary tablespace** instead of the undo tablespace.  
   - This **reduces undo tablespace usage** and improves performance.  

2. **How Does Temporary Undo Work?**  
   - When **`TEMP_UNDO_ENABLED=TRUE`**, undo for **temporary tables** is stored in the **temporary tablespace**, not in the undo tablespace.  
   - This applies to **DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)** on **global temporary tables (GTTs)**.  

3. **Why is E Correct? (Undo is stored in the temporary tablespace)**  
   - Since **temporary undo is enabled**, **any undo related to temporary tables** is written to the **temporary tablespace** instead of the undo tablespace.  
   - This avoids **redo logging overhead** and reduces resource usage.

### **Why Are the Other Options Incorrect?**  

| Option | Explanation |
|--------|------------|
| **A. in the undo tablespace** | ‚ùå **Wrong** ‚Üí Undo for normal tables is stored here, but **temporary tables use temporary undo in the temporary tablespace**. |
| **B. in the SYSAUX tablespace** | ‚ùå **Wrong** ‚Üí SYSAUX tablespace stores **metadata and system-related** information, not undo data. |
| **C. in the SGA** | ‚ùå **Wrong** ‚Üí SGA (System Global Area) stores **buffers and shared memory structures**, not undo records. |
| **D. in the PGA** | ‚ùå **Wrong** ‚Üí PGA (Program Global Area) is for **session-specific memory**, not undo data. |
