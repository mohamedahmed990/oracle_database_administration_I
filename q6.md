### **Question:**  
Which two statements are true about **UNDO and REDO**? (Choose two.)

**A.** The generation of **UNDO** generates **REDO**  
**B.** **DML** modifies Oracle database objects and only generates **UNDO**  
**C.** The generation of **REDO** generates **UNDO**  
**D.** **DML** modifies Oracle database objects and only generates **REDO**  
**E.** **DML** modifies Oracle database objects and generates **UNDO** and **REDO**  

---

### **Correct Answers:**  
‚úÖ **A. The generation of UNDO generates REDO**  
‚úÖ **E. DML modifies Oracle database objects and generates UNDO and REDO**  

---

### **Explanation:**

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ UNDO and REDO in Oracle Database**
- **UNDO**: Used to store old values of data before a change is committed. It helps with **transaction rollback and read consistency**.  
- **REDO**: Used to store information about changes made to the database. It helps **recover transactions in case of failure**.  

---

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Why "A" is Correct?**
‚úÖ **A. The generation of UNDO generates REDO**  
- When a **DML operation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)** occurs, Oracle first writes **undo data** (to roll back if needed).  
- Since UNDO is stored in the database, changes to the UNDO segment must also be **logged in the REDO logs** for recovery purposes.  
- **Thus, generating UNDO also generates REDO**.

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Why "E" is Correct?**
‚úÖ **E. DML modifies Oracle database objects and generates UNDO and REDO**  
- A **DML statement (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)** modifies database objects and must:
  - Generate **UNDO** to allow rollback.
  - Generate **REDO** to ensure changes are recorded for recovery.  
- Oracle writes both **UNDO and REDO records** to maintain data integrity and support transaction management.

### **Why the Other Options Are Incorrect?**

| Option | Explanation |
|--------|------------|
| **B. DML modifies Oracle database objects and only generates UNDO** | ‚ùå **Wrong** ‚Üí DML always generates both **UNDO and REDO**. UNDO alone is not enough for crash recovery. |
| **C. The generation of REDO generates UNDO** | ‚ùå **Wrong** ‚Üí REDO is generated **because of changes to the database**, not the other way around. UNDO is generated for rollback, not as a result of REDO. |
| **D. DML modifies Oracle database objects and only generates REDO** | ‚ùå **Wrong** ‚Üí DML **also generates UNDO**, which allows rollback and read consistency. |

---

### **Final Answer:**  
‚úÖ **A. The generation of UNDO generates REDO**  
‚úÖ **E. DML modifies Oracle database objects and generates UNDO and REDO**
