### **Question:**  
Which three statements are true about **undo segments** and the **use of undo by transactions** in an **Oracle database instance**? **(Choose three.)**  

**A.** An undo segment may be used by multiple transactions simultaneously  
**B.** Undo segments can wrap around to the first extent when a transaction fills the last extent of the undo segment  
**C.** Undo segments have a minimum of three extents  
**D.** Undo segments can extend when a transaction fills the last extent of the undo segment  
**E.** A single transaction may use multiple undo segments simultaneously  
**F.** Undo segments must be stored in a BIGFILE tablespace  
**G.** Undo segments must be stored in a SMALLFILE tablespace

### **Answer:**  
✅ **A. An undo segment may be used by multiple transactions simultaneously**  
✅ **C. Undo segments have a minimum of three extents**  
✅ **D. Undo segments can extend when a transaction fills the last extent of the undo segment**

### **Explanation:**  

#### **What Are Undo Segments?**  
Undo segments store **before-image data** for transactions to allow:  
- **Transaction rollback**  
- **Read consistency**  
- **Flashback operations**  

In **Automatic Undo Management (AUM)**, Oracle **automatically allocates** and **manages undo segments** inside the **UNDO tablespace**.

### **Why Are A, C, and D Correct?**  

✅ **A. An undo segment may be used by multiple transactions simultaneously**  
- **Correct** because multiple transactions **can share the same undo segment**.  
- Oracle assigns **transactions to undo segments dynamically** based on system activity.  
- However, **each transaction uses only one undo segment at a time**.  

✅ **C. Undo segments have a minimum of three extents**  
- **Correct** because Oracle **allocates a minimum of three extents** for each undo segment.  
- This ensures that there is **enough space** for transactions without immediate wraparounds.  
- Extents can grow dynamically as needed.  

✅ **D. Undo segments can extend when a transaction fills the last extent of the undo segment**  
- **Correct** because when a transaction **fills the last extent**, the undo segment **can grow by adding more extents**.  
- Oracle tries to **reuse expired extents first** before extending the segment.

### **Why Are the Other Options Incorrect?**  

| Option | Explanation |
|--------|------------|
| **B. Undo segments can wrap around to the first extent when a transaction fills the last extent of the undo segment** | ❌ **Wrong** → Oracle does **not allow wraparounds** if the extents are **still active**. Instead, the undo segment **extends** by adding new extents. |
| **E. A single transaction may use multiple undo segments simultaneously** | ❌ **Wrong** → A transaction **can use only one undo segment at a time**. However, if the transaction **becomes too large**, it may be moved to another undo segment. |
| **F. Undo segments must be stored in a BIGFILE tablespace** | ❌ **Wrong** → Undo segments **can be stored in either** BIGFILE or SMALLFILE tablespaces. |
| **G. Undo segments must be stored in a SMALLFILE tablespace** | ❌ **Wrong** → Oracle allows **both BIGFILE and SMALLFILE tablespaces** for undo segments. |

---

### **Final Answer:**  
✅ **A. An undo segment may be used by multiple transactions simultaneously**  
✅ **C. Undo segments have a minimum of three extents**  
✅ **D. Undo segments can extend when a transaction fills the last extent of the undo segment**
