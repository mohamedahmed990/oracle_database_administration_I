### **Question:**  
Which two statements are **true** about a **SQL statement using SET operators** such as `UNION`? **(Choose two.)**  

**A.** The **data type group** of each column returned by the second query must match the data type of the corresponding column returned by the first query.  
**B.** The **number**, but not names, of columns must be identical for all `SELECT` statements in the query.  
**C.** The **data type** of each column returned by the second query must **exactly** match the data type of the corresponding column returned by the first query.  
**D.** The **names and number** of columns must be identical for all `SELECT` statements in the query.  
**E.** The **data type** of each column returned by the second query must be **implicitly convertible** to the data type of the corresponding column returned by the first query.

### **Answer (Updated):**  
‚úÖ **A. The data type group of each column returned by the second query must match the data type of the corresponding column returned by the first query.**  
‚úÖ **B. The number, but not names, of columns must be identical for all `SELECT` statements in the query.**

### **Explanation:**  

1. **Why is A correct?**  
   - The **data type group** of each column in the second query **must match** the corresponding column in the first query.  
   - Oracle **does not allow** mixing different data type groups (e.g., `VARCHAR2` and `NUMBER`).  
   - Example (**Valid**):  
     ```sql
     SELECT emp_name FROM employees  
     UNION  
     SELECT cust_name FROM customers;  -- Both are VARCHAR2 (Character Data Type Group)
     ```
   - Example (**Invalid**):  
     ```sql
     SELECT emp_salary FROM employees  -- NUMBER  
     UNION  
     SELECT cust_name FROM customers;  -- VARCHAR2 (Error!)
     ```
   - If the data types are **not from the same group**, Oracle **raises an error** instead of performing implicit conversion.

2. **Why is B correct?**  
   - The number of columns must be **the same** in both queries.  
   - **Column names do not need to match**, as the result set takes the column names from the first query.  
   - Example (**Valid**):  
     ```sql
     SELECT emp_id, emp_name FROM employees  
     UNION  
     SELECT cust_id, cust_name FROM customers;  -- Both queries return 2 columns
     ```
   - Example (**Invalid**):  
     ```sql
     SELECT emp_id, emp_name FROM employees  
     UNION  
     SELECT cust_id FROM customers;  -- Error! Second query has only 1 column
     ```

### **Why Are the Other Options Incorrect?**  

| Option | Explanation |
|--------|------------|
| **C. The data type of each column returned by the second query must exactly match the data type of the corresponding column returned by the first query.** | ‚ùå **Wrong** ‚Üí Exact match is **not required**, only **the same data type group** is needed. |
| **D. The names and number of columns must be identical for all `SELECT` statements in the query.** | ‚ùå **Wrong** ‚Üí **Column names do not need to match**, only the **number of columns** must be the same. |
| **E. The data type of each column returned by the second query must be implicitly convertible to the data type of the corresponding column returned by the first query.** | ‚ùå **Wrong** ‚Üí **Implicit conversion is not allowed** across different data type groups. If a column is `NUMBER` in one query and `VARCHAR2` in another, Oracle returns an **error instead of converting**. |

### **Final Answer (Updated):**  
‚úÖ **A. The data type group of each column returned by the second query must match the data type of the corresponding column returned by the first query.**  
‚úÖ **B. The number, but not names, of columns must be identical for all `SELECT` statements in the query.**
