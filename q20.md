### **Question:**  
Which two statements are **true** regarding a **SAVEPOINT**? **(Choose two.)**  

**A.** Rolling back to a SAVEPOINT can undo a `CREATE INDEX` statement  
**B.** Rolling back to a SAVEPOINT can undo a `TRUNCATE` statement  
**C.** Only one SAVEPOINT may be issued in a transaction  
**D.** A SAVEPOINT does not issue a `COMMIT`  
**E.** Rolling back to a SAVEPOINT can undo a `DELETE` statement  

---

### **Answer:**  
‚úÖ **D. A SAVEPOINT does not issue a COMMIT**  
‚úÖ **E. Rolling back to a SAVEPOINT can undo a DELETE statement**  

---

### **Explanation:**  

#### **What Is a SAVEPOINT?**  
A **SAVEPOINT** in Oracle **marks a point within a transaction** to which you can later roll back.  
- It **does not commit** the transaction.  
- `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` **undoes changes made after the savepoint** but **does not affect changes before it**.  
- Multiple savepoints **can be set within a single transaction**.

### **Why Are D and E Correct?**  

‚úÖ **D. A SAVEPOINT does not issue a COMMIT**  
- **Correct** because a `SAVEPOINT` **only sets a point** in a transaction but does **not commit it**.  
- The transaction remains **active** until an explicit `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` is issued.  

‚úÖ **E. Rolling back to a SAVEPOINT can undo a DELETE statement**  
- **Correct** because `DELETE` is a **DML (Data Manipulation Language) operation**, which is transaction-controlled.  
- If you issue a `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`, the **DELETE operation is undone**, but other prior operations remain intact.  
- Example:
  ```sql
  SAVEPOINT sp1;
  DELETE FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10;
  ROLLBACK TO sp1;  -- The DELETE is undone, but the transaction is still active
  ```

### **Why Are the Other Options Incorrect?**  

| Option | Explanation |
|--------|------------|
| **A. Rolling back to a SAVEPOINT can undo a `CREATE INDEX` statement** | ‚ùå **Wrong** ‚Üí `CREATE INDEX` is a **DDL (Data Definition Language)** operation, which **automatically commits** the transaction. Thus, it **cannot** be rolled back. |
| **B. Rolling back to a SAVEPOINT can undo a `TRUNCATE` statement** | ‚ùå **Wrong** ‚Üí `TRUNCATE` is **DDL**, not DML. **It commits immediately** and **cannot** be rolled back. |
| **C. Only one SAVEPOINT may be issued in a transaction** | ‚ùå **Wrong** ‚Üí Multiple `SAVEPOINTS` **can** be set within a transaction. Example:  
  ```sql
  SAVEPOINT sp1;
  UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE department_id = 20;
  SAVEPOINT sp2;
  DELETE FROM employees WHERE department_id = 30;
  ROLLBACK TO sp2; -- Undoes DELETE but keeps the UPDATE
  ```

### **Final Answer:**  
‚úÖ **D. A SAVEPOINT does not issue a COMMIT**  
‚úÖ **E. Rolling back to a SAVEPOINT can undo a DELETE statement**
