### **Question:**  
You execute this command:  

```sh
[oracle@host01 ~]$ expdp system/oracle \
> FULL=Y \
> DUMPFILE=exp_db_full.dmp \
> PARALLEL=4 \
> LOGFILE=exp_db_full.log \
> JOB_NAME=exp_db_full
```

During the export operation, you detach from the job by using **CTRL+C** and then execute this command:  

```sh
Export> STOP_JOB=IMMEDIATE
```

Are you sure you wish to stop the job (**[yes/no]**): **yes**  

Which two statements are true about the job? **(Choose two.)**  

**A.** You can no longer monitor it  
**B.** You can reattach to it and monitor it  
**C.** It is paused and can be resumed  
**D.** It continues to run in the background  
**E.** It terminates  

---

### **Answer:**  
✅ **C. It is paused and can be resumed**  
✅ **E. It terminates**  

---

### **Explanation:**  

1. **What happens when you run `STOP_JOB=IMMEDIATE`?**  
   - Data Pump **immediately stops** the export job.  
   - The job does **not** continue running in the background.  
   - The job remains stored in the Data Pump job table, so it can be **resumed** later.

2. **Why is C correct? (It is paused and can be resumed)**  
   - You can **reattach and resume** the job later using:  
     ```sh
     expdp system/oracle ATTACH=exp_db_full
     ```
     Then, you can restart it using:  
     ```sh
     Export> START_JOB
     ```

3. **Why is E correct? (It terminates)**  
   - The job is **stopped immediately**, meaning it is not actively running anymore.
   - It does not continue executing unless manually resumed.

4. **Why are A, B, and D incorrect?**  
   - ❌ **A (You can no longer monitor it)** → Incorrect, because you **can** reattach and check its status.  
   - ❌ **B (You can reattach to it and monitor it)** → Incorrect in this context because once stopped, you cannot just monitor it—you need to resume it.  
   - ❌ **D (It continues to run in the background)** → Incorrect, because `STOP_JOB=IMMEDIATE` **stops execution immediately**, so it does not run in the background.

### **Final Answer:**  
✅ **C. It is paused and can be resumed**  
✅ **E. It terminates**
