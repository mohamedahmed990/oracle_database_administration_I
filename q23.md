### **Question:**  
Which three statements are true about advanced connection options supported by **Oracle Net** for connection to Oracle Database instances?  

#### **Options:**  
**A)** Connect Time Failover requires the use of Transparent Application Failover (TAF)  
**B)** Source Routing requires the use of a name server  
**C)** Source Routing enables the use of Connection Manager (CMAN), which enables network traffic to be routed through a firewall  
**D)** Load Balancing can balance the number of connections to dispatchers when using a Shared Server configuration  
**E)** Load Balancing requires the use of a name server  
**F)** Connect Time Failover requires the connect string to have two or more listener addresses configured

### **Correct Answers:**  
‚úÖ **C) Source Routing enables the use of Connection Manager (CMAN), which enables network traffic to be routed through a firewall**  
‚úÖ **D) Load Balancing can balance the number of connections to dispatchers when using a Shared Server configuration**  
‚úÖ **F) Connect Time Failover requires the connect string to have two or more listener addresses configured**

### **Explanation of Each Option:**  

#### **Option A: Connect Time Failover requires the use of Transparent Application Failover (TAF) ‚Üí ‚ùå Incorrect**  
- **Connect Time Failover (CTF) and Transparent Application Failover (TAF) are separate features.**  
- **CTF** helps establish a **new** connection if the first attempt to a listener fails. It occurs **before the session starts**.  
- **TAF** enables **automatic failover** of queries and sessions **after a failure occurs**, maintaining session state (partially).  
- **CTF does NOT require TAF**; you can use CTF independently.  

---

#### **Option B: Source Routing requires the use of a name server ‚Üí ‚ùå Incorrect**  
- **Source Routing** is a feature that allows connection requests to be **routed through multiple network hops**.  
- However, it **does NOT require a name server**.  
- **Oracle Connection Manager (CMAN)** is typically used for source routing, but it does not rely on a name server.  

---

#### **Option C: Source Routing enables the use of Connection Manager (CMAN), which enables network traffic to be routed through a firewall ‚Üí ‚úÖ Correct**  
- **CMAN (Oracle Connection Manager)** allows clients to connect to the database **through firewalls and intermediate network nodes**.  
- **Source Routing** enables connections to be **routed through CMAN**, controlling how database connections are handled.  
- This helps **bypass firewalls and enforce security policies**.  

---

#### **Option D: Load Balancing can balance the number of connections to dispatchers when using a Shared Server configuration ‚Üí ‚úÖ Correct**  
- **Load Balancing in Oracle Net** distributes **client connections** among **available instances, listeners, or dispatchers**.  
- When using a **Shared Server** configuration, multiple **dispatchers** handle user requests.  
- **Oracle Net Load Balancing** ensures **connections are evenly distributed** among these dispatchers, improving performance.  

---

#### **Option E: Load Balancing requires the use of a name server ‚Üí ‚ùå Incorrect**  
- **Load Balancing does NOT require a name server.**  
- Oracle Net **automatically balances** connections **without needing a separate name resolution service**.  
- It works through **listener-based** load balancing or **server-side** configuration.  

---

#### **Option F: Connect Time Failover requires the connect string to have two or more listener addresses configured ‚Üí ‚úÖ Correct**  
- **Connect Time Failover (CTF) allows Oracle Net to try multiple listeners** if the first one fails.  
- This requires **at least two listener addresses in the connect string**.  
- Example of a **CTF-enabled connection string**:  
  ```sql
  (DESCRIPTION=
      (ADDRESS_LIST=
          (ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=server1)(PORT=1521))
          (ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=server2)(PORT=1521))
      )
      (CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=mydb))
  )
  ```
- If `server1` is down, Oracle Net **automatically tries `server2`**.  

---

### **Final Summary:**  
| **Option** | **Correct?** | **Explanation** |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| **A** | ‚ùå | CTF and TAF are separate; CTF does **not** require TAF |
| **B** | ‚ùå | Source Routing does **not** require a name server |
| **C** | ‚úÖ | Source Routing enables **CMAN**, which helps route traffic through a firewall |
| **D** | ‚úÖ | Load Balancing distributes **connections to dispatchers** in a Shared Server configuration |
| **E** | ‚ùå | Load Balancing does **not** require a name server |
| **F** | ‚úÖ | CTF requires **two or more listener addresses** in the connect string |

Thus, the **correct answers** are:  
‚úÖ **C) Source Routing enables CMAN and firewall traversal**  
‚úÖ **D) Load Balancing distributes connections in Shared Server mode**  
‚úÖ **F) Connect Time Failover needs two or more listener addresses** üöÄ
