### **Question:**  
Your database instance was **shut down normally** and then started in **NOMOUNT** state.  

You then execute this command:  
```sql
ALTER DATABASE MOUNT;
```
Which two actions are performed? **(Choose two.)**  

**A.** The online redo logs are opened  
**B.** The online data files are opened  
**C.** The alert log records the execution details  
**D.** The Oracle background processes are started  
**E.** The initialization parameter file is read  
**F.** The control file is read  

---

### **Answer:**  
‚úÖ **C. The alert log records the execution details**  
‚úÖ **F. The control file is read**  

---

### **Explanation:**  

#### **Oracle Database Startup Process:**
1. **NOMOUNT stage** (`STARTUP NOMOUNT`):  
   - Reads the **initialization parameter file (`pfile` or `spfile`)** ‚úÖ  
   - Starts the **Oracle background processes** ‚úÖ  
   - Allocates **memory (SGA and PGA)**  
   - **Does NOT read the control file yet** ‚ùå  

2. **MOUNT stage** (`ALTER DATABASE MOUNT`):  
   - **Reads the control file** ‚úÖ  
   - Associates **control file with the instance**  
   - **Does NOT open data files or redo logs yet** ‚ùå  

3. **OPEN stage** (`ALTER DATABASE OPEN`):  
   - Opens the **data files** and **redo log files**

### **Why Are C and F Correct?**  

‚úÖ **C. The alert log records the execution details**  
- **Oracle writes the execution of `ALTER DATABASE MOUNT` to the alert log**.  
- The alert log keeps **critical startup messages** for DBA troubleshooting.  
- To check the alert log:  
  ```sh
  tail -f $ORACLE_BASE/diag/rdbms/<DB_NAME>/<INSTANCE_NAME>/trace/alert_<INSTANCE_NAME>.log
  ```

‚úÖ **F. The control file is read**  
- The **MOUNT** stage **reads the control file** to get metadata about the database.  
- The control file contains **database structure details**, including **data file and redo log locations**.

### **Why Are the Other Options Incorrect?**  

| Option | Explanation |
|--------|------------|
| **A. The online redo logs are opened** | ‚ùå **Wrong** ‚Üí Redo logs **are not opened** until the **OPEN** state. |
| **B. The online data files are opened** | ‚ùå **Wrong** ‚Üí Data files remain **closed** in **MOUNT** state; they are opened in the **OPEN** state. |
| **D. The Oracle background processes are started** | ‚ùå **Wrong** ‚Üí Background processes start in **NOMOUNT**, not during `ALTER DATABASE MOUNT`. |
| **E. The initialization parameter file is read** | ‚ùå **Wrong** ‚Üí The parameter file is read in the **NOMOUNT** stage, not in `ALTER DATABASE MOUNT`. |

### **Final Answer:**  
‚úÖ **C. The alert log records the execution details**  
‚úÖ **F. The control file is read**
