### **Answer:**  
‚úÖ **A. Oracle Managed Files (OMF)**  
‚úÖ **D. Automatic data file extension (AUTOEXTEND)**  
‚úÖ **E. Capacity planning growth reports based on historical data in the Automatic Workload Repository (AWR)**

### **Explanation:**
1. **Oracle Managed Files (OMF) (`A`)**  
   - Works with **both dictionary-managed** and **locally-managed tablespaces**.  
   - It automates file management, reducing administrative overhead.  
   - üìö **Reference:** [Oracle Managed Files (OMF)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/admin/managing-datafiles.html#GUID-DF3732D1-4571-47F4-818C-9C5B783BDB3E)  

2. **Automatic Data File Extension (`AUTOEXTEND`) (`D`)**  
   - Works with both tablespace types to **automatically increase file size** as needed.  
   - Ensures the database does not run out of space unexpectedly.  
   - üìö **Reference:** [AUTOEXTEND](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/admin/managing-space.html#GUID-BA85FABA-37B1-4E65-B59D-7B23C5B423F0)  

3. **Capacity Planning Growth Reports (AWR) (`E`)**  
   - AWR collects historical **tablespace usage trends** and provides growth reports.  
   - Works with **both dictionary-managed and locally-managed tablespaces**.  
   - üìö **Reference:** [AWR Growth Reports](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/dbrm/introduction-to-the-database-resource-manager.html#GUID-65863491-2E96-414D-A58E-4C6739314579)

### **Why Other Options Are Incorrect?**
| Option | Why It's Incorrect? |
|--------|----------------------|
| **B. Online Table Segment Shrink** | ‚ùå Requires **locally managed tablespaces** with **ASSM (Automatic Segment Space Management)**. Doesn't work with **dictionary-managed tablespaces**. |
| **C. Online Index Segment Shrink** | ‚ùå Also requires **ASSM**, which is available **only in locally managed tablespaces**. |

---

### **Final Answer:**  
‚úÖ **A. Oracle Managed Files (OMF)**  
‚úÖ **D. Automatic Data File Extension (AUTOEXTEND)**  
‚úÖ **E. Capacity Planning Growth Reports (AWR)**  

üöÄ **These features work for both Dictionary and Locally Managed Tablespaces!**
