### **Question:**  
You execute this command:  
```sql
CREATE BIGFILE TABLESPACE big_tbs  
   DATAFILE '/u01/oracle/data/big_f1.dbf'  
   SIZE 20G;
```
Sufficient storage is available in filesystem `/u01`.  
**Which two statements are true about the BIG_TBS tablespace?** *(Choose two.)*

A) AUTOEXTEND is possible for the datafile  
B) It must be bigger than the largest SMALLFILE tablespace  
C) Additional data files may not be added  
D) It will be a dictionary-managed tablespace by default  
E) It will always have a 32K blocksize  

---

### **Answer:**  
âœ… **A) AUTOEXTEND is possible for the datafile**  
âœ… **C) Additional data files may not be added**  

---

### **Explanation:**  
- A **BIGFILE tablespace** consists of **a single large datafile** (as opposed to multiple small files in a smallfile tablespace).  
- The **AUTOEXTEND** feature can be enabled for the datafile, allowing it to grow dynamically as needed.  
- Since **BIGFILE tablespaces** can only contain **one datafile**, **additional data files cannot be added**.

#### **Why are the other options incorrect?**  
- **B (Incorrect):** There is no requirement that a BIGFILE tablespace must be larger than a SMALLFILE tablespace.  
- **D (Incorrect):** Tablespaces are **locally managed** by default, not dictionary-managed.  
- **E (Incorrect):** The block size is not fixed at 32K; it depends on the database settings.  

Thus, the correct answers are **A and C**. ðŸš€
